# Chapter 1. The Challenge: Rethinking How Philadelphia Values Its Homes

## The Problem

Every year, thousands of Philadelphians buy or sell homes, and every transaction tells a story about how people value location, convenience, and opportunity.  
Yet the city’s current Automated Valuation Model doesn’t always capture these stories. Some neighborhoods are undervalued, while others bear unfairly high assessments.

::: {.callout-tip}
## What we are trying to explore?

1. **Price Gap:** Why do two homes with similar size and design sell for very different prices in Philadelphia?
2. **Spatial Drivers:** Which neighborhood, accessibility, and socioeconomic factors drive these differences?
3. **Fair Valuation:** How can understanding them help the city create a fairer, smarter system for property tax assessment?

## Highlight
![Our adjustment follows established mass appraisal practices, where implausible sale prices are identified and adjusted based on their ratio to assessed market value (Deaf Smith CAD, Mass Appraisal and Ratio Study Manual, 2023).](highlight.png)
```{r}

```

- **Principle**：Retain all information that the data tells us (including outliers) rather than deleting it.
- **Objective**：Ensure equity.
- **Relationship Formula**: Sale Price = -9189.29 + 1.03*Market value
- **Approach**: Unreliable(Predicted) sale price（low weight）~ Reliable sale price(high weight)

## Important
- For K-fold cross-validation, we use the entire dataset with replaced outliers for training to maintain consistency with the model derivation process. For the final test, however, we use a purified set that excludes all handled data, ensuring a reliable performance evaluation on genuine, trustworthy data.
