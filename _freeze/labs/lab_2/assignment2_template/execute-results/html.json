\n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\nINCOME_THRESHOLD <- 42112\nELDERLY_PCT_THRESHOLD <- 0.20\n\npa_vulnerable_tracts <- pa_tracts_demographics %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_65_over = pop_65_over / total_pop\n  ) %>%\n  filter(\n    med_hh_income < INCOME_THRESHOLD | \n    pct_65_over > ELDERLY_PCT_THRESHOLD  \n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#percentage of PA vulnerable census tracts\nvulnerable_tract_count <- nrow(pa_vulnerable_tracts)\ntotal_tract_count <- nrow(pa_tracts_demographics)\nvulnerable_percentage <- (vulnerable_tract_count / total_tract_count) * 100\n\ncat(\n  \"Percentage of PA census tracts considered vulnerable by your definition:\\n\",\n  paste0(round(vulnerable_percentage, 1), \"%\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nPercentage of PA census tracts considered vulnerable by your definition:\n 51.8%\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n  - I chose this threshold because it is significantly lower than Pennsylvania's 2022 statewide median household income (approximately $70,188). Setting the threshold at roughly 60% of the state median helps to identify areas experiencing severe economic disadvantage.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n  - I chose 20% because this is considered an indicator of a significantly aging population (higher than the average level in many states), and these areas have a higher demand for public transportation, healthcare, and social support services.\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n  - 1833 tracts\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n  - 53.2%\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n  # Standardize CRS\ndistricts <- st_transform(districts, st_crs(census_tracts))\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, st_crs(pa_counties))\ncensus_tracts <- st_transform(census_tracts, st_crs(pa_counties))\n\ntarget_crs <- 3857 \npa_vulnerable_tracts <- st_transform(pa_vulnerable_tracts, target_crs)\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, target_crs)\n\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital 中心点 (Centroid)\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(pa_vulnerable_tracts)\ndistance_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hospitals)\nnearest_hospital_distance_m <- apply(distance_matrix, 1, min)\n\n# 4. 将最近距离结果添加回脆弱普查区数据框\npa_vulnerable_tracts_final <- pa_vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_nearest_hospital = nearest_hospital_distance_m / 1609.344\n  ) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\naverage_distance <- pa_vulnerable_tracts_final %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  summarise(avg_dist = mean(dist_to_nearest_hospital, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(avg_dist)\n\n#maximum distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\nmax_distance <- pa_vulnerable_tracts_final %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  summarise(max_dist = max(dist_to_nearest_hospital, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(max_dist)\n\n#more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital\ntracts_over_15_miles <- pa_vulnerable_tracts_final %>%\n  filter(dist_to_nearest_hospital > 15) %>%\n  nrow()\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n  - 6.21 miles\n- What is the maximum distance?\n  - 39.78 miles\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n  - 167 tracts\n- Why you chose your projection\n  - The core reason for choosing any projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is that accurate distance calculations require flat coordinates, not latitude and longitude coordinates. This CRS is chosen for its convenience and wide compatibility. It is the standard used by almost all web mapping services. For maximum accuracy within a single state like Pennsylvania, a dedicated state plane system like NAD83 / Pennsylvania South (EPSG: 2272) would be technically superior as it minimizes distance distortion across the state. However, 3857 is widely acceptable for most regional analyses.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create underserved variable\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create and format priority counties table\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n- Include descriptive column names\n- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\n- Add an informative caption\n- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization \n\nUsing the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create publication-quality maps and charts.\n\n### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth \n\nCreate a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the county level.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create county-level access map\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Fill counties by percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Include hospital locations as points\n- Use an appropriate color scheme\n- Include clear title, subtitle, and caption\n- Use `theme_void()` or similar clean theme\n- Add a legend with formatted labels\n\n---\n\n### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map \n\nCreate a map highlighting underserved vulnerable tracts.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create detailed tract-level map\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Show underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting color\n- Include county boundaries for context\n- Show hospital locations\n- Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?)\n- Include informative title and subtitle\n\n---\n\n### Chart: Distribution Analysis\n\nCreate a visualization showing the distribution of distances to hospitals for vulnerable populations.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create distribution visualization\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Suggested chart types:**\n- Histogram or density plot of distances\n- Box plot comparing distances across regions\n- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county\n- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Clear axes labels with units\n- Appropriate title\n- Professional formatting\n- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis \n\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.\n\n### Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). \n\n**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve.
