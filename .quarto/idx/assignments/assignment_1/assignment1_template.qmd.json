The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

These factors present specific data quality challenges that are critical to evaluating algorithmic fairness.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n```{r county-data}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\ncounty_data_texas <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",        # 检索县级数据\n  variables = c(                # 指定要获取的变量及其描述性名称\n    median_household_income = \"B19013_001\",\n    total_population = \"B01003_001\"\n  ),\n  state = my_state,            # 指定州\n  year = 2022,                 # 指定年份\n  survey = \"acs5\",             # 指定使用5年期调查\n  output = \"wide\"              # 指定输出为宽格式\n)\n\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\ncounty_data_texas <- county_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    # remove state name（Texas）\n    NAME = str_remove(NAME, \", Texas\"),\n    # remove \" County\"\n    NAME = str_remove(NAME, \" County\")\n  )\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(county_data_texas)\n```\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  - High Confidence: MOE < 5%\n  - Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%  \n  - Low Confidence: MOE > 10%\n- Create a flag for unreliable estimates (MOE > 10%)\n\n**Hint:** Use `mutate()` with `case_when()` for the categories.\n\n```{r income-reliability}\n# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()\ncounty_data_texas <- county_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Calculate MOE percentage\n    income_moe_pct = (median_household_incomeM / median_household_incomeE) * 100,\n    \n    # Create reliability categories\n    income_reliability = case_when(\n      income_moe_pct < 5 ~ \"High Confidence\",\n      income_moe_pct >= 5 & income_moe_pct <= 10 ~ \"Moderate Confidence\",\n      income_moe_pct > 10 ~ \"Low Confidence\"\n    ),\n    \n    # Create a flag for unreliable estimates\n    unreliable_income = income_moe_pct > 10\n  )\n# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category\n# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  count(income_reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100\n  )\n```\n\n## 2.3 High Uncertainty Counties\n\n**Your Task:** Identify the 5 counties with the highest MOE percentages.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Sort by MOE percentage (highest first)\n- Select the top 5 counties\n- Display: county name, median income, margin of error, MOE percentage, reliability category\n- Format as a professional table using `kable()`\n\n**Hint:** Use `arrange()`, `slice()`, and `select()` functions.\n\n```{r high-uncertainty}\n# Create table of top 5 counties by MOE percentage\nlibrary(knitr)\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  arrange(desc(income_moe_pct)) %>%\n  slice(1:5) %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `Margin of Error` = median_household_incomeM,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n\n# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption\nkable(\n    caption = \"Top 5 Counties with The Highest MOE Percentages\",\n    digits = 2\n  )\n```\n\n**Data Quality Commentary:**\nBased on these results, algorithmic funding decisions relying on the median income in counties like Jeff Davis and Culberson (with MOE>50%) would be highly unreliable. These counties risk being poorly served because the true income value could be far outside the estimate, potentially leading to the algorithm severely over-allocating or under-allocating crucial resources. The extreme uncertainty is primarily due to small population size and low survey response rates, making precise income estimation statistically impossible in these sparsely populated areas.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n```{r select-counties}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- county_data_texas %>%\n  filter(\n    income_moe_pct > 30 |\n    (income_moe_pct >= 5 & income_moe_pct <= 10) |\n    income_moe_pct < 2\n  ) %>%\n  # select 3\n  group_by(income_reliability) %>%\n  slice(1)\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"3 Counties Selected for Tract-Level Study\",\n    digits= 2\n  )\n```\n\n**Comment on the output:** \nI deliberately selected counties representing the more extreme ends of the High and Low Confidence ranges. This strategy ensures a clearer and more impactful comparison of data quality. By focusing on these distinct cases (one very high confidence, one moderate, and one very low confidence), the tract-level analysis will better expose the full spectrum of data reliability issues that could affect the department's funding algorithms.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

This means data reliability is not merely poor in isolated cases, but universally insufficient across these neighborhoods.\n\nThe average population size for all these unreliable tracts is around 5,345 people, with a high average concentration of Hispanic residents (61.29%). This pattern strongly suggests that in small, high-minority counties, the reliability of demographic estimates completely breaks down at the tract level. The lack of sufficient sample size in these relatively small, rural, tracts makes the ACS data inherently unstable.\n\nConsequently, any algorithm relying on this demographic data in these counties would be making resource allocation decisions based on pure statistical uncertainty, disproportionately impacting Hispanic-majority communities with unreliable information.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nThe analysis reveals a two-tiered, systematic breakdown in data reliability:\nCounty Level: High Margin of Error (MOE), some exceeding 60%, is concentrated in sparsely populated counties like Jeff Davis and Culberson. These areas immediately fail basic reliability thresholds for household income estimates.\nTract Level: In the targeted focus areas—selected to represent the full spectrum of county-level reliability—100% of all tracts examined fell into the High Uncertainty category (MOE>15% on demographic variables). This means data quality completely collapses at the neighborhood level within these regions, rendering reliable demographic data universally insufficient for allocation decisions.\n\nThe communities facing the greatest risk of algorithmic bias are those defined by small population size and high minority concentration. The High MOE tracts show a distinct demographic profile, with an average of over 61% Hispanic residents. An algorithm relying on these unstable estimates will apply the highest level of statistical guesswork—with MOE values that often double the estimate—to resource decisions concerning these Hispanic-majority communities. This introduces a serious risk of systemic bias, where funding allocation is based on conjecture rather than precise, equitable data.\n\nThe underlying factor driving both data quality issues and the resulting bias risk is the insufficient statistical sample size combined with geographical isolation. In sparsely populated, often rural counties, the ACS cannot collect enough household responses to produce stable estimates for either income or demographics. Because high-minority communities are overrepresented in these low-population areas in Texas, the data gaps systematically align with ethnic lines, translating a statistical problem into an undeniable equity problem.\n\nTo mitigate this systemic risk and ensure equitable allocation, the Department should implement the following strategic measures:\n1. Mandatory Reliability Threshold: Implement a strict rule requiring that any data used by the allocation algorithm must have an MOE percentage below a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 10%). Funding allocation logic must be halted if this threshold is breached.\n2. Data Disaggregation Protocol: For all counties or tracts flagged as \"High Uncertainty\" (MOE>15% on key variables), the algorithm must default to using supplementary, non-ACS data (such as administrative program enrollment records, local school data, or poverty indices) rather than relying on unreliable census estimates.\n3. Human Review Flag: Program the algorithm to automatically flag and defer funding decisions for any tract with high data uncertainty to a human review committee, ensuring local context and qualitative data are applied where quantitative data is weakest.\n\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\nmutate(\n    `Algorithm Recommendation` = case_when(\n      # High Confidence: MOE < 5%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      # Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      # Low Confidence: MOE > 10%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Algorithmic Implementation Framework\",\n    digits = 2 # 保留两位小数\n  )\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]\nCounties categorized as High Confidence (those with median income MOE below 5%) are suitable. These typically include large, urban counties with stable estimates, such as Harris or Dallas County. They are appropriate because their data is statistically stable, meaning resource allocations based on the income estimates are highly reliable (>95% certainty), minimizing the risk of systemic misallocation.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]\nCounties categorized as Moderate Confidence (median income MOE between 5% and 10%) should be deployed with caution. The Department must implement real-time monitoring to compare algorithmic allocation decisions against actual service uptake and ground-level case worker reports. A 5%-10% uncertainty range requires human oversight to validate outcomes and trigger manual review if the allocation pattern appears to deviate significantly from expected need.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\nAll Low Confidence counties (MOE>10%), especially those with extreme uncertainty like Jeff Davis (MOE≈66%) and Culberson (MOE≈53%), must have standard algorithmic application immediately suspended. For these areas, where tract-level data is universally unreliable and serves high Hispanic populations, the Department must transition to manual case worker review for needs assessment, or invest in small, targeted administrative surveys (e.g., using food security or Medicaid data) as a more reliable proxy for need than the ACS income estimates.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n1. How do the tracts flagged with High MOE cluster geographically, and is there a measurable correlation between these clusters and existing disparities in access to Department resources or social infrastructure?\n2. Beyond the Hispanic population, are High MOE issues equally prevalent across other small, concentrated minority groups (e.g., specific Native American or Asian subgroups), or is the sample size challenge uniquely impacting the Hispanic population in the Texas border regions?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on September 19, 2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [your version]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://github.com/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/portfolio-setup-ChristineCui12\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Describe any decisions you made about data processing, county selection, or analytical choices that might affect reproducibility]\nThe analysis employed several deliberate choices to focus the data quality evaluation. First, all estimates were sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates to ensure the most geographically detailed and statistically stable data available for tract-level analysis. Second, the three focus counties were intentionally selected based on the MOE analysis to represent the extremes of data reliability (High, Moderate, Low Confidence MOE ranges) rather than simply picking counties near the confidence boundaries. This was done to maximize the observed contrast in data quality patterns during the tract-level deep dive. **Third, a conservative 15% MOE threshold was set for the tract-level demographic variables. If the MOE for any of the three major demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic) exceeded this threshold, the entire tract was flagged as High MOE.**\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\nThe findings are restricted to Texas and the three specifically selected counties. The conclusion that 100% of tracts in the focus area are unreliable is an extreme finding that may not be generalizable to counties in other parts of the state or country. Besides, the use of 5-Year ACS estimates means the data represents a rolling average from 2018 to 2022. This dampens volatility but may mask rapid economic changes or population shifts that have occurred since the beginning of the period.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [√] All code chunks run without errors\n- [√] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [√] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [√] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [√] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [√] Census API key is properly set \n- [√] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.

These factors present specific data quality challenges that are critical to evaluating algorithmic fairness.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n```{r county-data}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\ncounty_data_texas <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",        # 检索县级数据\n  variables = c(                # 指定要获取的变量及其描述性名称\n    median_household_income = \"B19013_001\",\n    total_population = \"B01003_001\"\n  ),\n  state = my_state,            # 指定州\n  year = 2022,                 # 指定年份\n  survey = \"acs5\",             # 指定使用5年期调查\n  output = \"wide\"              # 指定输出为宽格式\n)\n\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\ncounty_data_texas <- county_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    # remove state name（Texas）\n    NAME = str_remove(NAME, \", Texas\"),\n    # remove \" County\"\n    NAME = str_remove(NAME, \" County\")\n  )\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(county_data_texas)\n```\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  - High Confidence: MOE < 5%\n  - Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%  \n  - Low Confidence: MOE > 10%\n- Create a flag for unreliable estimates (MOE > 10%)\n\n**Hint:** Use `mutate()` with `case_when()` for the categories.\n\n```{r income-reliability}\n# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()\ncounty_data_texas <- county_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Calculate MOE percentage\n    income_moe_pct = (median_household_incomeM / median_household_incomeE) * 100,\n    \n    # Create reliability categories\n    income_reliability = case_when(\n      income_moe_pct < 5 ~ \"High Confidence\",\n      income_moe_pct >= 5 & income_moe_pct <= 10 ~ \"Moderate Confidence\",\n      income_moe_pct > 10 ~ \"Low Confidence\"\n    ),\n    \n    # Create a flag for unreliable estimates\n    unreliable_income = income_moe_pct > 10\n  )\n# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category\n# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  count(income_reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100\n  )\n```\n\n## 2.3 High Uncertainty Counties\n\n**Your Task:** Identify the 5 counties with the highest MOE percentages.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Sort by MOE percentage (highest first)\n- Select the top 5 counties\n- Display: county name, median income, margin of error, MOE percentage, reliability category\n- Format as a professional table using `kable()`\n\n**Hint:** Use `arrange()`, `slice()`, and `select()` functions.\n\n```{r high-uncertainty}\n# Create table of top 5 counties by MOE percentage\nlibrary(knitr)\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  arrange(desc(income_moe_pct)) %>%\n  slice(1:5) %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `Margin of Error` = median_household_incomeM,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n\n# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption\nkable(\n    caption = \"Top 5 Counties with The Highest MOE Percentages\",\n    digits = 2\n  )\n```\n\n**Data Quality Commentary:**\nBased on these results, algorithmic funding decisions relying on the median income in counties like Jeff Davis and Culberson (with MOE>50%) would be highly unreliable. These counties risk being poorly served because the true income value could be far outside the estimate, potentially leading to the algorithm severely over-allocating or under-allocating crucial resources. The extreme uncertainty is primarily due to small population size and low survey response rates, making precise income estimation statistically impossible in these sparsely populated areas.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n```{r select-counties}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- county_data_texas %>%\n  filter(\n    income_moe_pct > 30 |\n    (income_moe_pct >= 5 & income_moe_pct <= 10) |\n    income_moe_pct < 2\n  ) %>%\n  # select 3\n  group_by(income_reliability) %>%\n  slice(1)\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"3 Counties Selected for Tract-Level Study\",\n    digits= 2\n  )\n```\n\n**Comment on the output:** \nI deliberately selected counties representing the more extreme ends of the High and Low Confidence ranges. This strategy ensures a clearer and more impactful comparison of data quality. By focusing on these distinct cases (one very high confidence, one moderate, and one very low confidence), the tract-level analysis will better expose the full spectrum of data reliability issues that could affect the department's funding algorithms.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.\n\n```{r tract-demographics}\n# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names\nethnicity_variables <- c(\n  white_alone = \"B03002_003\",\n  Black_African_American = \"B03002_004\",\n  Hispanic_Latino = \"B03002_012\",\n  total_population = \"B03002_001\"\n)\n\n# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data\n# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter\nselected_county_geoids <- selected_counties$GEOID\nselected_county_codes <- str_sub(selected_county_geoids, start = -3) #the last 3 numbers of GEOID is county codes\n\ntract_data_texas <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",        # 普查区级别\n  variables = ethnicity_variables,         # 指定要获取的变量及其描述性名称\n  state = my_state,            # 指定州\n  county = selected_county_codes, # 将县的 GEOID 作为 county 参数\n  year = 2022,                 # 指定年份\n  survey = \"acs5\",             # 指定使用5年期调查\n  output = \"wide\"              # 指定输出为宽格式\n)\n\n# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()\n# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations\ntract_data_texas <- tract_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_white = (white_aloneE / total_populationE) * 100,\n    pct_black = (Black_African_AmericanE / total_populationE) * 100,\n    pct_hispanic = (Hispanic_LatinoE / total_populationE) * 100\n  )\n\n# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar\ntract_data_texas <- tract_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n   Tract  = str_extract(NAME, \"Census Tract \\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?\"),\n   County = str_extract(NAME, \"[A-Za-z]+ County\")\n  )\n\nhead(tract_data_texas)\n\n```\n\n## 3.3 Demographic Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.\n\n```{r demographic-analysis}\n# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents\n# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract\n\ntop_hispanic_tract <- tract_data_texas %>%\n  # 1. 按照 Hispanic/Latino 百分比 (pct_hispanic) 降序排列\n  arrange(desc(pct_hispanic)) %>%\n  slice(1)\ntop_hispanic_tract %>%\n  \n  kable(\n    caption = \"Tract with the Highest Percentage of Hispanic/Latino Residents\",\n  )\n\n# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()\n# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group\ncounty_demographics_summary <- tract_data_texas %>%\n  # 1. 按照县进行分组\n  group_by(County) %>%\n  # 2. 计算每个县的汇总统计量\n  summarize(\n    number_of_tracts = n(),\n    # 计算各族裔/种族群体的平均百分比\n    avg_pct_white = mean(pct_white, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_black = mean(pct_black, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_pct_hispanic = mean(pct_hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),\n    # 计算县的总人口 (可以选择计算所有普查区人口的总和)\n    total_population_E = sum(total_populationE, na.rm = TRUE),\n  )\n  # 3. 格式化并展示结果\n  county_demographics_summary %>%\n    select(\n      `County` = County,\n      `Tracts` = number_of_tracts,\n      `Avg White/%` = avg_pct_white,\n      `Avg Black/%` = avg_pct_black,\n      `Avg Hispanic/%` = avg_pct_hispanic,\n      `Total Pop` = total_population_E\n    ) %>%\n    # 使用 kable() 格式化输出为表格\n    kable(\n      caption = \"Average Demographics by County\",\n      digits = 2 # 百分比和小数保留一位\n    )\n```\n\n# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation\n\n## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables\n\n**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable\n- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%\n- Create summary statistics\n\n```{r demographic-moe}\n# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables\n# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)\ntract_data_texas <- tract_data_texas %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Calculate MOE percentage\n    white_moe_pct = (white_aloneM / white_aloneE) * 100,\n    black_moe_pct = (Black_African_AmericanM / Black_African_AmericanE) * 100,\n    hispanic_moe_pct = (Hispanic_LatinoM / Hispanic_LatinoE) * 100,\n    \n# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable\n# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement\n    demographic_reliability = ifelse(\n      white_moe_pct > 15 | black_moe_pct > 15 | hispanic_moe_pct > 15,\"High MOE\",\n      \"Acceptable\"\n    )\n  )\n    \n# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues\n# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()\ntract_data_texas %>%\n  count(demographic_reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100\n  )\n```\n\n## 4.2 Pattern Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.\n\n```{r pattern-analysis}\n# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues\n# Calculate average characteristics for each group:\n# -

This means data reliability is not merely poor in isolated cases, but universally insufficient across these neighborhoods.\n\nThe average population size for all these unreliable tracts is around 5,345 people, with a high average concentration of Hispanic residents (61.29%). This pattern strongly suggests that in small, high-minority counties, the reliability of demographic estimates completely breaks down at the tract level. The lack of sufficient sample size in these relatively small, rural, tracts makes the ACS data inherently unstable.\n\nConsequently, any algorithm relying on this demographic data in these counties would be making resource allocation decisions based on pure statistical uncertainty, disproportionately impacting Hispanic-majority communities with unreliable information.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nThe analysis reveals a two-tiered, systematic breakdown in data reliability:\nCounty Level: High Margin of Error (MOE), some exceeding 60%, is concentrated in sparsely populated counties like Jeff Davis and Culberson. These areas immediately fail basic reliability thresholds for household income estimates.\nTract Level: In the targeted focus areas—selected to represent the full spectrum of county-level reliability—100% of all tracts examined fell into the High Uncertainty category (MOE>15% on demographic variables). This means data quality completely collapses at the neighborhood level within these regions, rendering reliable demographic data universally insufficient for allocation decisions.\n\nThe communities facing the greatest risk of algorithmic bias are those defined by small population size and high minority concentration. The High MOE tracts show a distinct demographic profile, with an average of over 61% Hispanic residents. An algorithm relying on these unstable estimates will apply the highest level of statistical guesswork—with MOE values that often double the estimate—to resource decisions concerning these Hispanic-majority communities. This introduces a serious risk of systemic bias, where funding allocation is based on conjecture rather than precise, equitable data.\n\nThe underlying factor driving both data quality issues and the resulting bias risk is the insufficient statistical sample size combined with geographical isolation. In sparsely populated, often rural counties, the ACS cannot collect enough household responses to produce stable estimates for either income or demographics. Because high-minority communities are overrepresented in these low-population areas in Texas, the data gaps systematically align with ethnic lines, translating a statistical problem into an undeniable equity problem.\n\nTo mitigate this systemic risk and ensure equitable allocation, the Department should implement the following strategic measures:\n1. Mandatory Reliability Threshold: Implement a strict rule requiring that any data used by the allocation algorithm must have an MOE percentage below a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 10%). Funding allocation logic must be halted if this threshold is breached.\n2. Data Disaggregation Protocol: For all counties or tracts flagged as \"High Uncertainty\" (MOE>15% on key variables), the algorithm must default to using supplementary, non-ACS data (such as administrative program enrollment records, local school data, or poverty indices) rather than relying on unreliable census estimates.\n3. Human Review Flag: Program the algorithm to automatically flag and defer funding decisions for any tract with high data uncertainty to a human review committee, ensuring local context and qualitative data are applied where quantitative data is weakest.\n\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\ncounty_data_texas %>%\n  select(\n    `County Name` = NAME,\n    `Median Income` = median_household_incomeE,\n    `MOE Percentage` = income_moe_pct,\n    `Reliability Category` = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\nmutate(\n    `Algorithm Recommendation` = case_when(\n      # High Confidence: MOE < 5%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      # Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      # Low Confidence: MOE > 10%\n      `Reliability Category` == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Algorithmic Implementation Framework\",\n    digits = 2 # 保留两位小数\n  )\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]\nCounties categorized as High Confidence (those with median income MOE below 5%) are suitable. These typically include large, urban counties with stable estimates, such as Harris or Dallas County. They are appropriate because their data is statistically stable, meaning resource allocations based on the income estimates are highly reliable (>95% certainty), minimizing the risk of systemic misallocation.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]\nCounties categorized as Moderate Confidence (median income MOE between 5% and 10%) should be deployed with caution. The Department must implement real-time monitoring to compare algorithmic allocation decisions against actual service uptake and ground-level case worker reports. A 5%-10% uncertainty range requires human oversight to validate outcomes and trigger manual review if the allocation pattern appears to deviate significantly from expected need.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\nAll Low Confidence counties (MOE>10%), especially those with extreme uncertainty like Jeff Davis (MOE≈66%) and Culberson (MOE≈53%), must have standard algorithmic application immediately suspended. For these areas, where tract-level data is universally unreliable and serves high Hispanic populations, the Department must transition to manual case worker review for needs assessment, or invest in small, targeted administrative surveys (e.g., using food security or Medicaid data) as a more reliable proxy for need than the ACS income estimates.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n1. How do the tracts flagged with High MOE cluster geographically, and is there a measurable correlation between these clusters and existing disparities in access to Department resources or social infrastructure?\n2. Beyond the Hispanic population, are High MOE issues equally prevalent across other small, concentrated minority groups (e.g., specific Native American or Asian subgroups), or is the sample size challenge uniquely impacting the Hispanic population in the Texas border regions?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on September 19, 2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [your version]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://github.com/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/portfolio-setup-ChristineCui12\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[Describe any decisions you made about data processing, county selection, or analytical choices that might affect reproducibility]\nThe analysis employed several deliberate choices to focus the data quality evaluation. First, all estimates were sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates to ensure the most geographically detailed and statistically stable data available for tract-level analysis. Second, the three focus counties were intentionally selected based on the MOE analysis to represent the extremes of data reliability (High, Moderate, Low Confidence MOE ranges) rather than simply picking counties near the confidence boundaries. This was done to maximize the observed contrast in data quality patterns during the tract-level deep dive. **Third, a conservative 15% MOE threshold was set for the tract-level demographic variables. If the MOE for any of the three major demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic) exceeded this threshold, the entire tract was flagged as High MOE.**\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\nThe findings are restricted to Texas and the three specifically selected counties. The conclusion that 100% of tracts in the focus area are unreliable is an extreme finding that may not be generalizable to counties in other parts of the state or country. Besides, the use of 5-Year ACS estimates means the data represents a rolling average from 2018 to 2022. This dampens volatility but may mask rapid economic changes or population shifts that have occurred since the beginning of the period.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [√] All code chunks run without errors\n- [√] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [√] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [√] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [√] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [√] Census API key is properly set \n- [√] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
