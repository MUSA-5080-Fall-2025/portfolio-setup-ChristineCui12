## Key Concepts Learned
- **Part 1: Where We Are**
  - Review
    - Weeks 1-3: Data foundations
      - Census data, tidycensus, spatial data basics
      - Visualization and exploratory analysis
    - Week 5: Linear regression fundamentals
      - Y = f(X) + ε framework
      - Train/test splits, cross-validation
      - Checking assumptions
    - Week 6: Expanding the toolkit
      - Categorical variables and interactions
      - Spatial features (buffers, kNN, distance)
      - Neighborhood fixed effects
  - **The Regression Workflow**
    - Building the model:
      - Visualize relationships
      - Engineer features
      - Fit the model
      - Evaluate performance (RMSE, R²)
      - Check assumptions
    - Spatial diagnostics:
      - Are errors random or clustered?
      - Do we predict better in some areas?
      - Is there remaining spatial structure?
    - If errors cluster spatially, it suggests:
      - Missing spatial variables
      - Misspecified relationships
      - Non-stationarity (relationships vary across space) 非平稳性
- **Part 2: Understanding Spatial Patterns in Errors**
  - Visualizing Error Patterns（误差有聚集，不随机，不好）→怎么改进：fixed
- **Part 3: Moran’s I**
  - Moran’s I measures spatial autocorrelation
  - Range: -1(Perfect negative correlation (dispersion)) to +1(Perfect positive correlation (clustering)),0 = Random spatial pattern
  -  wij = spatial weight between locations i and j (0 or 1)
    

## Coding Techniques

  - the basic workflow: pull-commit-push
- Areas needing more practice
  - remember the essential dplyr functions
