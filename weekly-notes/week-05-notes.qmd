## Key Concepts Learned
- 1.The Statistical Learning Framework
  - Formalizing the Relationship Y=f(X)+ϵ
    - Why Estimate f? 1.Prediction 2. Inference推理
    - How Do We Estimate f? **Parametric Methods**(We assume f is linear, then estimate β₀ and β₁) Non-Parametric Method(We let the data determine the shape of f)
  - Parametric Approach: Linear Regression参数方法：线性回归
    - The assumption: Relationship between X and Y is linear. Y≈β0+β1X1+β2X2+...+βpXp(Estimate the β coefficient系数)
- 2.Two Different Goals
- 3.Building Your First Model
  - Fit the Model
  - Interpreting Coefficients
  - The “Holy Grail” Concept(all the estimation is based on the sample,not the entire pop.so we will never know the true relationship)(No relationship一条横线: Null Hypothesis)
  - Statistical Significance
    - t value
    - p value
- 4.Model Evaluation
  - How Good is This Model?
    - How well does it fit the data we used? (in-sample fit:**R²**,R² = 0.208 means “21% of variation in income is explained by population”**R² alone doesn’t tell us if the model is trustworthy**)(**Overfitting**:High R² doesn’t mean good predictions!)
    - How well would it predict new data? (out-of-sample performance:**Train70%/Test30% Split**)
      - Code:set.seed(123)
n <- nrow(pa_data)
  - Evaluate Predictions
    - Code:# Calculate prediction error (RMSE)
rmse_test <- sqrt(mean((test_data$median_incomeE - test_predictions)^2))
rmse_train <- summary(model_train)$sigma平方是为了放大error
  - Cross-Validation(Better approach: Multiple train/test splits)
- 5.Checking Assumptions
  - **Assumption 1: Linearity**
    - What we assume: Relationship is actually linear
    - How to check: Residual plot(clear funnel pattern & random scatter)
  - **Assumption 2: Constant Variance**
    - Heteroscedasticity(异方差性): Variance changes across X(residual变大的时候思考是否需要引入新变量来解释→Adding the right predictor can fix heteroscedasticity)
    - Impact: Standard errors are wrong → p-values misleading
  - Formal Test: Breusch-Pagan(进行异方差性（Heteroscedasticity）的统计假设检验，而 p 值是这个检验的最终输出和决策工具)
    - Interpretation: p > 0.05: Constant variance assumption OK; p < 0.05: Evidence of heteroscedasticity
    - Solutions: 1.Transform Y (try log(income)) 2.Robust standard errors 3.Add missing variables 4.Accept it (point predictions still OK for prediction goals)
  - Assumption: Normality of Residuals(Q-Q Plot)
  - **Assumption 3: No Multicollinearity**
  - **Assumption 4: No Influential Outliers**
    - Not all outliers are problems - only those with high leverage AND large residuals
    - Identify Influential Points(Cook’s D > 4/n = potentially influential)
- 6.Improving the Model
  - Adding More Predictors
  - Log Transformations
    - If relationship is curved, try transforming
    - Interpretation changes: Log models show percentage relationships
  - **Categorical Variables(create new variables)**
