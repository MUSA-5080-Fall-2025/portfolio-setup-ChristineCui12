## Key Concepts Learned
- Algorithmic Decision Making(算法)
  - Definition
    - A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or completing a task
    - Instructor 
  - Algorithmic Decision Making in Government
    - Systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers
    - Based on predictions from models that process historical data containing Inputs X and Outputs Y(labels,outcome)
  - Real-World Examples
    1. Criminal Justice
    2. Housing & Finance
    3. Healthcare
  - Problems: Statistical discrimination;
  - Key Terms
    - Data Science: Computer science/engineering focus on algorithms and methods
    - Data Analytics: Application of data science methods to other disciplines
    - Machine Learning: Algorithms for classification & prediction that learn from data
    - AI: Algorithms that adjust and improve across iterations (neural networks, etc.)(迭代)
  - Public Sector Context
    - Government data collection
    - New data
  - Why Government Uses Algorithms
  - When Algorithms Go Wrong
    - Data Analytics Is Subjective
      - Every step involves human choices(embed human values and biases)
        - Data cleaning decisions
        - Data coding or classification
        - Data collection - use of imperfect proxies
        - How you interpret results
        - What variables you put in the model
      - Example
        - Healthcare Algorithm Bias
        - Criminal Justice Algorithm Bias
        - Dutch Welfare Fraud Detection
- Active Learning Exercise
  - scenario:School enrollment assignment
  - Proxy: What would you use to stand in for what you want?
    - Distribution of children
    - Transportation accessibility & Transit, bus stop, subway station
  - Blind spot: What data gap or historical bias could skew results?
    - Socioeconomic Bias(ignore income or car ownership rate)
  - Harm + Guardrail: Who could be harmed, and one simple safeguard?
    - People in the remote area with poor transportation accessibility
- Census Data Foundations
  - Census vs. American Community Survey
    - Decennial Census(Everyone counted every 10 years, 9 basic questions, Constitutional requirement)
    - American Community Survey (**ACS**)(3% of households surveyed annually, Detailed questions)
  - Census Geography Hierarchy
    - Nation
    - Regions  
    - States
    - **Counties**
    - **Census Tracts** (1,500-8,000 people)
    - **Block Groups** (600-3,000 people)  
    - Blocks (≈85 people, Decennial only)
  - 2020 Census Innovation: Differential Privacy
    - Add mathematical “noise” to protect privacy while preserving overall patterns
  - Accessing Census Data in R
  - ACS Data Structure
  - Margins of Error(**MOE**)
    - Rule: Large MOE relative to estimate = less reliable, Small MOE relative to estimate = more reliable
    - Recommendation: Always report MOE alongside estimates, Consider using 5-year estimates for greater reliability
  - Two Types of Census Data
  - Data Sources
    - TIGER/Line Files
    - Historical Data Sources
- Hands-On Census Data with R
    

## Coding Techniques
- [New R functions or approaches]
- [Quarto features learned]

## Questions & Challenges
- What I didn't fully understand
  - the basic workflow: pull-commit-push
- Areas needing more practice
  - remember the essential dplyr functions

## Connections to Policy
- [How this week's content applies to real policy work]

## Reflection
- [What was most interesting]
- [How I'll apply this knowledge]
