## Key Concepts Learned
- Converting to Spatial Data
  - Step 1: Make your data spatial
    - library(sf）
      # Convert boston data to sf object
      boston.sf <- boston %>%
        st_as_sf(coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326) %>%
        st_transform('ESRI:102286')  # MA State Plane (feet)
  - Step 2: Spatial Join with Neighborhoods
    - Categoral variables: NOT continuous numeric data
- Expanding Your Regression Toolkit
  - Dummy Variables
  - Add Dummy (Categorical) Variables to the Model
    - 当你的自变量是文字而不是数字时（比如社区名称"Back Bay", "Beacon Hill"等），R会自动将它们转换成一系列二进制虚拟变量。
    - 关键规则：(n-1)原则,如果有n个类别，R只会创建(n-1)个虚拟变量，自动省略一个作为参照组。
  - Interpreting Neighborhood Dummy Variables
  - Interaction Effects: When Relationships Depend
    - Theory: Luxury Premium Hypothesis()
  - Create the Neighborhood Categories
    - Model 1: No Interaction (Parallel Slopes)
    - Model 2: With Interaction (Different Slopes)
    - Interpreting the Interaction Coefficients()
    - Compare Model Performance
    - When Not To Use Interactions
    -
