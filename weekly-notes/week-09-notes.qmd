## Key Concepts Learned
- **Part 1: The Seductive Promise of Predictive Policing**
- **Part 2: The Dirty Data Problem**
  - Definition
    - Traditional definition (data mining): Missing data, Incorrect data, Non-standardized formats
    - Extended definition: “Data derived from or influenced by **corrupt, biased, and unlawful practices**, including data that has been intentionally manipulated or ‘juked,’ as well as data that is distorted by individual and societal biases.”
  - Forms of Dirty Data
    - Fabricated/Manipulated Data
    - Systematically Biased Data
    - Missing/Incomplete Data
    - Proxy Problems
- **Part 3: Technical Fixes Can’t Solve Social Problems**
- **Part 4: Consequences and Harms**
- **Part 5: Can Reform Work?**
  - Consent Decrees
    - Training on constitutional policing
    - Early intervention systems for problem officers
    - Revised use-of-force policies
    - Community oversight
    - Data collection improvements
- **Part 6: A Framework for Critical Evaluation**
  - Questions to Ask About Any Predictive Policing System
    - 1. Data Provenance
    - 2. Variable Selection
    - 3. Validation
    - 4. Deployment
    - 5. Transparency & Accountability
    - 6. Alternatives
- **Technical Foundations**
  - **Modeling Workflow** highly important
  - The Core Logic: “Broken Windows Theory”
  - a. Local Spatial Autocorrelation
  - b. Count Regression Fundamentals
    - Problems for counts: negative values are impossible for counts, counts often have variance ≠ mean, counts are discrete (not continuous), count data is skewed (not normal errors) **Overdispersion common!!**
    - **The Poisson Distribution**-Appropriate for count data
      - **Key property: Mean = Variance = λ**
    - **Poisson Regression Model**
      - Log link: Ensures λi>0 (counts can’t be negative)
      - Linear relationship on log scale
    - **Interpreting Poisson Coefficients**
      - On log scale: β1  = change in log(expected count) per unit increase in X1
      - On count scale (exponentiate指数): exp(β1)  = multiplicative effect on expected count (exp(β1)-1)是变化
    - **Check for overdispersion**: Dispersion=Residual Deviance/Degrees of Freedom (If ≈ 1: Poisson is fine, If > 1: Overdispersion, If > 2-3: Serious overdispersion → Use Negative Binomial)
    - **Negative Binomial Regression**
