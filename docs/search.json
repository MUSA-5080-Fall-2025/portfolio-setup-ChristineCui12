    "text": "The Problem\nEvery year, thousands of Philadelphians buy or sell homes, and every transaction tells a story about how people value location, convenience, and opportunity.\nYet the city’s current Automated Valuation Model doesn’t always capture these stories. Some neighborhoods are undervalued, while others bear unfairly high assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we are trying to explore?\n\n\n\nPrice Gap: Why do two homes with similar size and design sell for very different prices in Philadelphia?\nSpatial Drivers: Which neighborhood, accessibility, and socioeconomic factors drive these differences?\nFair Valuation: How can understanding them help the city create a fairer, smarter system for property tax assessment?"
