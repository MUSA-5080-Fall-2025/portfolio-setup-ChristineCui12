The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality.\nThe red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions.\n\n1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 × Market Value Rule)\n\nThere is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000).\nThese are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market.\n\n2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5  Market Value Rule)*\n\nThere are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X).\nThese are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value.\nRetaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data! That’s too big to let go, The model that we want to generate will become much more stable if we can make use of them.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# filter the REAL MARKET data in the time period we need\nopa_selected &lt;- opa_var %&gt;% \n  filter(\n    non_market==0,\n    sale_date &gt;= \"2023-01-01\" & sale_date &lt;= \"2024-12-31\"\n  )   \n\n#filter the NON MARKET data in the time period we need\nopa_non_market &lt;- opa_var %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    non_market ==1,\n    sale_date &gt;= \"2023-01-01\" & sale_date &lt;= \"2024-12-31\"\n    )\n\nopa_selected2 &lt;- opa_var\nopa_bonus &lt;- opa_var \n\n\n\n\nCode\n#try to find the relationship between market_value and sale_price\noptions(scipen = 999)\nplot(opa_selected$sale_price, opa_selected$market_value,\n     xlab = \"Sale Price\", ylab = \"Market Price\",\n     main = \" Market Value vs  Sale Price (cleaned)\",\n     pch = 19, col = rgb(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.4))\nabline(0,1,col=\"red\",lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# That's quite linear, let's try to build a simple OLS model\nopa_mdata &lt;- opa_bonus %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    non_market == 0\n    )\n\nmodel_non &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ market_value, data = opa_mdata)\nsummary(model_non)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ market_value, data = opa_mdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1432832   -35207    -1669    30014  1975714 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate   Std.

The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality.\nThe red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions.\n\n1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 × Market Value Rule)\n\nThere is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000).\nThese are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market.\n\n2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5  Market Value Rule)*\n\nThere are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X).\nThese are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value.\nRetaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data! That’s too big to let go, The model that we want to generate will become much more stable if we can make use of them.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# filter the REAL MARKET data in the time period we need\nopa_selected &lt;- opa_var %&gt;% \n  filter(\n    non_market==0,\n    sale_date &gt;= \"2023-01-01\" & sale_date &lt;= \"2024-12-31\"\n  )   \n\n#filter the NON MARKET data in the time period we need\nopa_non_market &lt;- opa_var %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    non_market ==1,\n    sale_date &gt;= \"2023-01-01\" & sale_date &lt;= \"2024-12-31\"\n    )\n\nopa_selected2 &lt;- opa_var\nopa_bonus &lt;- opa_var \n\n\n\n\nCode\n#try to find the relationship between market_value and sale_price\noptions(scipen = 999)\nplot(opa_selected$sale_price, opa_selected$market_value,\n     xlab = \"Sale Price\", ylab = \"Market Price\",\n     main = \" Market Value vs  Sale Price (cleaned)\",\n     pch = 19, col = rgb(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.4))\nabline(0,1,col=\"red\",lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# That's quite linear, let's try to build a simple OLS model\nopa_mdata &lt;- opa_bonus %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    non_market == 0\n    )\n\nmodel_non &lt;- lm(sale_price ~ market_value, data = opa_mdata)\nsummary(model_non)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sale_price ~ market_value, data = opa_mdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1432832   -35207    -1669    30014  1975714 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate   Std.

This means that the majority of houses have lower prices, and very expensive houses are very few in number.\nConcentration and Outliers: The count of houses in each bin drops rapidly as the price increases. The number of houses above $2,500,000 is very small, indicating the presence of extreme high-price outliers.\nPreprocessing Requirement: This distribution strongly suggests that before building a house price prediction model, the Sale Price variable will need a transformation, most commonly a log transformation, to make the distribution more closely resemble a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n3.2 Spatial distribution of sale prices (map)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_all &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(price_quartile = ntile(sale_price_predicted, 4))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = philly_census, fill = \"lightgrey\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(data = opa_census_all, aes(color = factor(price_quartile)), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    direction = -1,\n    labels = c(\"0%-25%\", \"25%-50%\", \"50%-75%\", \"75%-100%\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Housing Sales Price in Philadelphia (2023–2024)\",\n    color = \"Sale Price Quartile\"\n  )  +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nSpatial Concentration of Housing Prices: Highest Prices are clearly concentrated in the Center City/Downtown area of Philadelphia and its immediate surroundings, which indicates that the most expensive property transactions occur in the high-value areas of and around the city center.\nDiscontinuous Price Transitions: Housing prices do not exhibit smooth gradients across the city; instead, they show abrupt changes between different price quartiles, forming distinct spatial clusters. This suggests that price variations are influenced by fixed boundaries such as neighborhoods, infrastructure, or socio-economic factors, rather than continuous spatial diffusion.\nPeripheral Price Patterns: Lower-price quartiles (0%-25% and 25%-50%) are predominantly located in the outer regions of the city, particularly in the northern and southern peripheries, indicating a clear core-periphery divide in housing values.\n\n\n\n3.3 Price vs. structural features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted))\n\n# 1️⃣ total_livable_area\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = log(total_livable_area), y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Log(Livable Area)\",\n    x = \"Log(Total Livable Area)\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 2️⃣ number_of_bathrooms\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = number_of_bathrooms, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Bathrooms\",\n    x = \"Number of Bathrooms\",  \n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 3️⃣ interior_condition\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = interior_condition, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\", width = 0.2, height = 0) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Interior Condition\",\n    x = \"Interior Condition\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 4️⃣ house_age\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = house_age^2, y = log_sale_price)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. House Age²\",\n    x = \"House Age² (2025 - Year Built)²\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nStrong Positive Correlation with Size and Bathrooms: There is a clear positive linear relationship between the log of sale price and both the log of total livable area and the number of bathrooms. This indicates that larger properties and those with more bathrooms command significantly higher market prices.\nNon-Linear Relationship with Interior Condition: While a general positive trend exists, the relationship between log sale price and interior condition rating is not perfectly linear. The data dispersion suggests that the effect of interior condition on price may be subject to diminishing marginal returns or other non-linear dynamics.\nNegative Correlation with House Age Squared: A significant negative relationship is observed between log sale price and the squared term of house age. This indicates that property values depreciate as homes get older, and this depreciation effect may accelerate over time, reflecting a non-linear aging effect on housing value.\n\n\n\n3.4 Price vs. spatial & Social features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted),\n    sqrt_crime_count = sqrt(crime_count)\n  )\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = ba_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. BA Rate\",\n       x = \"Bachelor's Degree Rate\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = unemployment_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Unemployment Rate\",\n       x = \"Unemployment Rate\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = median_income, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Median Income\",\n       x = \"Median Household Income (USD)\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = avg_past_price_density, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Past Price Density\",\n       x = \"Average Past Price Density\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np5 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = sqrt_crime_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. √(Crime Count)\",\n       x = \"Square Root of Crime Count\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np6 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = transit_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Transit Count\",\n       x = \"Number of Transit Stops Nearby\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 | p2 | p3) / (p4 | p5 | p6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nStrong Socioeconomic Influence: Housing prices show clear positive correlations with key socioeconomic indicators. Both bachelor’s degree rate and median household income exhibit strong positive relationships with sale prices, indicating that neighborhoods with higher educational attainment and income levels command substantially higher property values.\nNegative Impact of Crime and Unemployment: There are evident negative relationships between housing prices and both crime levels (measured by square root of crime count) and unemployment rates. This demonstrates that public safety and local economic vitality are significant determinants of property values in Philadelphia.\nPositive Effects of Historical Prices and Transit Access: Sale prices maintain a positive relationship with both historical price density and accessibility to public transportation. This suggests that areas with established high-value characteristics and better transit infrastructure maintain their premium in the housing market, reflecting path dependence in neighborhood valuation and the value of transportation accessibility.\n\n\n\nOther visualization\n\n\nCode\ntract_price &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_past_price_density = mean(avg_past_price_density, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_price, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = avg_past_price_density), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",\n    name = \"Mean Sale Price Per sqft\",\n    labels = scales::dollar_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  scale_alpha(range = c(0.2, 0.8), name = \"Interior Condition\") +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Buffered Area Mean Sold Price of 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"clustered in census tracts\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_condition &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_interior_condition = mean(interior_condition, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_condition, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_interior_condition), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"#6A1B9A\", high = \"white\",\n    name = \"Avg Interior Condition\",\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Interior Condition by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color = better average condition\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_area &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_total_livable_area = mean(total_livable_area, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_area, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_total_livable_area), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",   \n    name = \"Avg Livable Area (sqft)\",\n    labels = scales::comma_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Livable Area by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color indicates larger average livable area\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nSpatial Variation in Property Values: The average sale price per square foot shows significant geographic clustering across census tracts, with distinct high-value areas concentrated in specific neighborhoods. This indicates strong spatial autocorrelation in housing prices, where adjacent tracts tend to have similar price levels.\nCorrelation Between Property Condition and Location: Better average interior conditions are systematically concentrated in particular geographic areas, suggesting that housing maintenance and quality are not randomly distributed but follow spatial patterns that may correlate with neighborhood characteristics and property values.\nHeterogeneous Distribution of Housing Size: The average livable area varies substantially across census tracts, with larger properties clustered in specific regions. This spatial patterning of housing size complements the price distribution, indicating that both property characteristics and location factors contribute to the overall housing market structure in Philadelphia."

Combined with the insignificant linear term, this suggests a slight U-shaped relationship, where new homes and very old homes (perhaps with historical value) command a premium over middle-aged homes.\ninterior_condition (-0.114): Assuming a higher value means worse condition, each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with an 11.4% decrease in price.\n\nquality_grade_num (0.070): Each one-unit increase in the quality grade is associated with a 7.0% increase in price.\nfireplaces (0.117): Each additional fireplace is associated with a 11.7% increase in price.\ngarage_spaces (0.143): Each additional garage space is associated with a 14.3% increase in price.\ncentral_air_dummy (0.458): Homes with central air are estimated to be 45.8% more expensive than the baseline (e.g., no AC).

This suggests Model 1 overestimated the impact of area. Why? Because larger homes are often located in wealthier neighborhoods. Model 1 incorrectly attributed some of the “wealthy neighborhood” premium to “large area.”\nquality_grade_num (0.0015 vs 0.070): The coefficient for quality grade became statistically insignificant (p=0.520). This is a key finding: home quality is highly correlated with neighborhood income. Once we directly control for income (income_scaled), the independent effect of quality grade disappears.\ncentral_air_dummy (0.219 vs 0.458): The premium for central air was halved. This also indicates that central air is more common in affluent areas, and Model 1 suffered from significant Omitted Variable Bias (OVB).\n\nNew Variable (Census) Interpretation:\n\nincome_scaled (0.455): A one-unit increase in standardized census tract income is associated with a 45.5% increase in price. A very strong positive effect.\nba_rate (0.0129): A 1 percentage point increase in the neighborhood’s bachelor’s degree attainment rate is associated with a 1.3% price increase.\nunemployment_rate (-0.0066): A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 0.66% decrease in price.\n\n\n4.3 Spatial features:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_3 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-3.03217 -0.09905  0.05666  0.18464  2.17114 \n\nCoefficients:\n                               Estimate   Std.

This suggests people prefer to live further away from hospitals (perhaps to avoid noise, traffic, or sirens), not closer.\n\n\n4.4 Interactions and fixed effects:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_4 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3)+\n                \n                  (interior_condition * income_scaled)+  #FE & Interaction\n                  factor(zip_code),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_4)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3) + (interior_condition * income_scaled) + \n    factor(zip_code), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.86007 -0.09067  0.05500  0.16974  2.17553 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                     Estimate   Std.

It shows that the impact of interior_condition depends on income_scaled.\nThe total marginal effect of interior_condition is:\\[= -0.1695 + 0.1165 \\times \\text{income\\_scaled}\\]\nAt the baseline income level (income_scaled = 0), each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with a 17.0% price decrease (-0.1695). However, this penalty is mitigated (lessened) in higher-income areas. For each one-unit increase in income_scaled, the negative penalty of poor condition is reduced by 11.7 percentage points. This may imply that in high-income neighborhoods, “fixer-uppers” (homes in poor condition) are seen as investment opportunities with high renovation potential. Therefore, the market penalty for “poor condition” is smaller."

This finding robustly confirms that the physical scale of a property remains a primary determinant of its market value. A larger livable space directly provides more utility and functionality, which homebuyers are consistently willing to pay a premium for. Its strength as a predictor underscores that, despite the importance of location and market trends, the core structure and size of a house still fundamentally matter.\n\nComparable Sales – Capturing Appraiser Logic and Micro-Market Dynamics:\n\nThe historical sale prices of nearby properties (modeled as average past price density) serve as a powerful predictive feature. This variable effectively allows the model to “think like a real appraiser” by incorporating the most relevant and recent market transactions as references. It captures hyperlocal, block-by-block market momentum and the value influence that comparable homes exert on a subject property. By leveraging this spatial and temporal proximity, the feature helps to correct for the inherent time lag in other census-based data and anchors the price prediction in real-time, micro-level market activity.\n\nZip Code Fixed Effects – The Ultimate Location Premium:\n\nThe inclusion of Zip Code Fixed Effects proves to be the most consequential “game-changer” in the model. While other variables capture specific, quantifiable aspects of a property, this feature holistically encapsulates the unobserved, intangible value associated with a specific location. It quantifies the true “location value” premium, capturing a wide array of factors that are difficult to measure directly but are capitalized into housing prices, such as school district quality, neighborhood prestige, long-term desirability, and overall “market mood.” Its dominant role confirms that in the Philadelphia housing market, the answer to “Where is it?” often carries more weight than “What is it?”, as the zip code effectively bundles the net effect of all locational advantages and community characteristics."

    "text": "Phase 7: Conclusions & Recommendations\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur final model’s R² is 0.84, indicating that the model explains 84% of the variance in log sale prices. The RMSE is 124437.8USD, showing that the model’s predictions are reasonably close to the observed values.\n\nLivable Area of the House matters most for Philadelphia prices.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEquity concerns\n\nWhich neighborhoods are hardest to predict?\n\nThe largest prediction errors occur primarily in central Philadelphia, where both overestimation and underestimation coexist within close proximity. This pattern indicates that the model struggles most in areas with high housing heterogeneity- neighborhoods that contain a mix of old row houses, newly renovated apartments, and varying property types within short distances.\n\nIn contrast, outer neighborhoods such as those in the northwest and northeast tend to have more consistent housing characteristics, leading to smaller residuals. The central tracts’ larger residuals suggest that cultural or historical features have introduced variability that the model’s current features (mainly physical characteristics) cannot fully explain.\n\nAny data bias?\n\nThe observed spatial pattern of prediction errors reflects inherent data bias. The dataset likely overrepresents mid-range housing conditions and underrepresents both luxury and low-income housing. As shown in the livable area and interior condition maps, data coverage in wealthier areas (especially the northwest) is limited, and these tracts often contain more unique, high-value properties that the model cannot generalize well.\n\nWealthier tracts are more likely to be well-documented, while poorer areas lack records, creating spatial imbalance in model performance.\n\nHigh-priced homes typically have larger negotiation margins, meaning their final sale prices are often lower than the listed prices. In contrast, low-priced homes sell closer to their listing prices. As a result, model tends to overestimate expensive homes and underestimate affordable ones, introducing systematic bias.\n\n\nRecommendations to government\n\nImmediate System Calibration: We recommend utilizing our model’s findings to immediately adjust property assessments in systematically overvalued low-income communities. This action will ensure a fair distribution of the tax burden and address current inequities.\n\n\n\nIntegrate Advanced Spatial Features: We advise the Office of Property Assessment (OPA) to permanently integrate the effective spatial characteristics identified by our study—specifically Comparable Sales Proxies (surrounding transaction prices) and Neighborhood Fixed Effects—into the next-generation AVM. This will significantly enhance the model’s responsiveness to rapidly changing market dynamics.\n\n\n\nExtreme high values almost exclusively stem from corporate transactions and require manual review for outliers.\n\nLimitations and next steps\n\nLimitations: Inherent Data Biases\n\nOur predictive accuracy is constrained by inherent data biases which affect equity. We find a dual challenge in data coverage: in affluent areas, high-value, unique properties suffer from data sparsity, making generalization difficult. Conversely, lower-income areas often show data incompleteness, leading to less reliable predictions and higher residual errors. Critically, we observed a price-tier bias: high-priced homes tend to sell below their list price, while low-priced homes transact closer to it. This systemic pattern means the model is prone to over-assessing expensive properties and under-assessing affordable ones, creating a structural risk for vertical inequity in the tax system.\n\n\nNext Steps: Enhancing Data Quality and Fairness\n\nTo address these limitations, our next steps focus on data enrichment and equitable optimization. The City should partner with us to integrate non-public data, such as detailed appraisal records and permit data, which can account for unobserved renovation quality and close the data gap. Furthermore, to combat the systematic price-tier bias, we recommend integrating fairness metrics directly into the AVM’s optimization process. This will shift the model’s objective beyond simple average accuracy (RMSE) to ensure that prediction errors are uniformly low across all price tiers and all Philadelphia neighborhoods, securing both accuracy and equity."
